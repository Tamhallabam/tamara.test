    <h2>Why did i start doing this at my age?</h2>
  	
    <p>My partner is a full stack developer so it just kinda rubs off on you after a while. 
      He would sit there and potter on his computer, sometimes i would read a book. Sometimes you're just too tired to read
       and i would watch tv or play pointless and annoying games on my phone. 
      But that all got a bit too, well, pointless and annoying after a while. </p>
